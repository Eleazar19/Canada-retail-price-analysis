# Spotting price differentials across provinces 


## Title: Canadian retail price report


## Project description:

In Canadian provinces, product pricing and price changes remain a significant factor in determining consumer buying behavior. For a better understanding of this key factor (price), this analysis focuses on examining price changes from several perspectives, including annual price fluctuations and the variation in prices of consumer products across several Canadian provinces.

## Insights:

- It was discovered that provinces 2,3,4,5 have the highest tax rate (15%) across consumer product categories such as canned & jarred goods, frozen foods, grains & bakery, meat & poultry, toiletries & cleaning, and vegetables.

- Essential products have more tax levied on them than non-essential products.

- Under the taxed essential category, toiletries & cleaning, Vegetables, grains & bakery, meat & poultry are the most taxed essential categories with a 15% tax rate.

- As a result of different tax rates levied on taxable products by each province, this results in different prices for taxable products across all provinces.

### Trend:
- The total tax paid by consumers in 2025 saw a sharp decline of 83.33%, amounting to ($217.48).

- Infant formula experienced the most price change ($26-$45) (73.08%) from 2017-2025. Signifying a steady upward trend in price.

- The average price of egg, an essential product, remained stable across provinces 1-10 at $4, except province 11, where the price experienced a slight increase of $5.

### Hypothesis:
- Infant & baby products are not taxed across all provinces, because they remain an essential product in the diet for babies, mostly at their early/young age.


## Recommendations:
- Knowing the importance of essential consumer products across various provinces in satisfying the most pertinent want of consumers, the tax levied on these products should be reviewed downward in order to make them more affordable for consumers.

- Government across provinces should consider having a unified tax rate for all taxable product as this will help in tackling price disparity across provinces, seeing to it that consumers will be able to pay a pocket friendly price for this product no matter the province they leave in.

- Conduct a localized market assessment in Province 11 to identify the factors contributing to the price increase of egg. This may include examining supply chain disruptions, transportation costs, demand fluctuations, or regulatory issues.
